This fork of https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid adds an environment for the AI Safety concern of Scalable Supervision [in this file](gym_minigrid/envs/scalableoversight.py). It also adds a [wrapper](gym_minigrid/wrappers.py) for partial observability, and some basic rendering in [rendering](gym_minigrid/rendering.py) and [minigrid](gym_minigrid/minigrid.py). 

This forms the environment that I benchmarked agents against in my [thesis](Thesis.pdf).

for a quick start on the SS environment, run 
``
./manual_control.py --env MiniGrid-ScalableOversightVISUALISE-v0
``

More details are the [file](gym_minigrid/envs/scalableoversight.py) and the thesis.

You will need to use this in conjunction with https://github.com/louism33/torch-ac and https://github.com/louism33/gym-minigrid

This is an example of an agent performing on the training dataset generated by the hyperparameters Phones=1, Dirts=1, Known=1, Unknown=1.
It presses the button when the situation is Unknown (meaning it does not know what is under the grey Mess/Unknown cells), and does not press it on the Known
situations, when the Mess cells always have the same cells underneath.
